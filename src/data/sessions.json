      "description": "As a developer, you want freedom to build. In a world where cloud providers are increasingly trying to exert influence, Wigo4it consciously chooses autonomy. We share our approach to remaining independent while using the Azure cloud, and how we design, build, and think in a cloud-agnostic way. It’s not a flawless success story, there are challenges and trade-offs, but it offers an honest look behind the scenes. What works, what doesn't, and where we’re still making progress. You’ll walk away with insights you can start applying right away.",
