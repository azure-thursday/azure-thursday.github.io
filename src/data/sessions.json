      "title": "You‚Äôve got the Power (Platform)! Controlling developers in Azure DevOps",
      "description": "Developers have it all figured out with their code flows, everything is quickly pushed to production and it‚Äôs up to the processes to make sure nothing breaks down. But does this always work?<br />During this talk I will show you how to create extra controls on Pull Requests in Azure DevOps, which need to be passed before a piece of code is accepted. This is achieved by connecting to the Power Platform with Logic Apps and Power Apps. To make sure this process stays very user friendly, Power Apps are used to create a front-end to manage these extra steps.<br />Do you want to make sure your developers follow your processes without giving them extra work or more tools to learn? I bet you do! So join this talk and learn how to do this.",
